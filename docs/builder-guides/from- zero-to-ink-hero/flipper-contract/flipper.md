# Full-stack Flipper App
## Prerequisites

This tutorial targets developers with an **basic** level in ink! and an **beginner** level in Rust.   
Please follow these tutorials first:

To follow this tutorial you will need:
- to [set up your ink! environment](../../XVM%20and%20WASM/setup_your_ink_environment.md)
- to [know "Hello, World! - The Flipper"](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/)
- to [install swanky](../../../wasm/sc-dev/swanky/)
- any substrate wallet in your browser([Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), [Subwallet](https://subwallet.app/) etc)
- SBY(Native token in Shibuya Network, which is our testnet) in your wallet from [faucet](https://portal.astar.network/#/shibuya-testnet/assets)

## What will we do ?

in this tutorial we will compile&deploy flipper contract written in ink! and interact with it from flipper application UI.

## What will we use ?

[flipper(wasm-showcase-dapps)](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/wasm-showcase-dapps/tree/main/flipper)   

## What will you learn ?

- How to compile & deploy the simplest ink! smartcontract in testnet.
- Structure of repo of web application to interact with smartcontract from UI

## Summary

Steps
1. Compile flipper contract with Swanky
2. Deploy the contract with Swanky and get the contract address
3. Run the app
4. Set the contract address
5. Login with wallet
6. flip and get result

### Setting

Clone repo 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AstarNetwork/wasm-showcase-dapps
```
and Install dependencies by running `yarn`
```bash
cd wasm-showcase-dapps/flipper
yarn
```

0. Init

In `./contract` folder run
```bash
swanky init flipper
```
and chose `flipper` as template and as contract name. Chose `n` when asking to download swanky node.
If you get this error `âœ– Error Checking dependencies`, please make sure you complete [setting up ink! environment](../../XVM%20and%20WASM/setup_your_ink_environment.md)s.
<!--
1. Start the local node

- `cd flipper`
- `swanky node start`
-->
1. Build the contract

```bash
swanky contract compile flipper
```

2. deploy the contract
local
```bash
swanky contract deploy flipper --account alice -g 100000000000 -a true
```
Shibuya
```bash
swanky contract deploy flipper --account alice --gas 100000000000 --args true --network shibuya
```

Note down the contract address.

Instead of using swanky, you can input this contract address for a while,

### Compile
```rust
swanky contract compile flipper
```

### Folder Structure
| File Name                                                                   | About                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cargo.toml              | Package Config       |          
|  lib.rs |  Your contract logic |

After your first compile, you will get 2 more files:

| File Name                                                                   | About                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Target              | build info, binary info       |
